Yep!There can be no understating it: Ethereum and Blockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years. Companies cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are a tiny number of resources published to help you truly understand what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them. That's the purpose of this course: to be the best resource online for learning about Ethereum, blockchains, and how to build apps with this new technology.The development community is still figuring out the best way to use Ethereum in the creation of new and exciting apps.  I spent a tremendous amount of time to research and create best practice for interfacing with Ethereum from Javascript. I can't overstate it enough; this course will show you the best and most easily repeatable patterns for creating production-ready apps with Ethereum."
